here in this git repo i demonstrated my use of git repo on a python file 
and I have learned to track changes in a code 

Challenges i faced while working on this file
*creating a main branch on the terminal
*commiting  a modified file to the main branch (it took me  LITTLE bit longer to figure it)

Advantages 
*I know understand how git works and how important a git repo is  and purpose of a branch in a repository
